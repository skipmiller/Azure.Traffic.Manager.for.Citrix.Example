# Case Study: Azure Traffic Manager for Citrix Cold Standby Failover

## Executive Summary

This case study demonstrates the implementation of an Azure Traffic Manager solution for a Citrix Virtual Apps environment requiring automatic failover between dual ISP connections. The solution addresses the challenge of maintaining business continuity when the primary internet connection fails, while optimizing costs by keeping the backup connection offline during normal operations.

## Business Challenge

### The Problem
- **Critical Dependency:** Enterprise relies on Citrix for remote workforce access
- **Single Point of Failure:** Primary ISP outage would disable remote access for all users
- **Cost Constraints:** Keeping dual ISP connections active 24/7 was cost-prohibitive
- **Manual Processes:** Existing failover required manual DNS changes with 15-30 minute downtime

### Requirements
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** < 2 minutes
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** 0 (no data loss acceptable)
- **Cost Optimization:** Backup ISP only active during outages
- **Automation:** No manual intervention required for failover
- **Monitoring:** Proactive alerting for all stakeholders
